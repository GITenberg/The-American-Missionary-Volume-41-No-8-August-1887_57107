<p>The next Annual Meeting of the Association will be held at
Portland, Me., Oct. 25th to 27th. Rev. A.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;F. Behrends, D.D.,
of Brooklyn, will preach the sermon. The friends in Portland have
already begun preparations for the reception of the Association.
Life Members, Delegates chosen by contributing churches, Local
Conferences, State Associations and the National Council,
constitute the Annual Meeting. So far as possible, the Portland
churches will entertain those who attend. Those purposing to be
present and wishing entertainment are requested to write to Rev.
C.&nbsp;H. Daniels, Chairman of the Committee of Entertainment, or Rev.
S.&nbsp;K. Perkins, Secretary, Portland, Me. Applications must be made
before Oct. 1st. Special rates will be arranged at hotels for those
who desire to pay their own way. Railroad and steamboat favors will
be secured as far as possible, and notices of reductions and other
matters will appear later in the magazine and in the religious
press.</p>

<p>We face an unpleasant fact. Receipts in July last year were a
little over $42,000. This was unprecedented. It was owing to the
special collection taken by the churches July 4th for the debt.
Nevertheless, it became a part of our year’s work, and those heavy
receipts entered into the total. There are now but two months
remaining. Shall our total receipts be allowed to fall behind those
of last year? At the end of June we were just about even with last
year. But the outlook for July is not encouraging. However, we know
that our friends have the money, and we do not believe they are
going to allow us to fall behind. We ask them favorably to consider
our request that they make a special effort to lift the watermark
of our treasury at least as high as it reached last year, and, if
possible, lift it up just a little higher.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In conferring the degree of D.D. upon Rev. Henry Hopkins of Kansas
City, and of LL.D. upon Gen. Sam’l C. Armstrong, Principal of the
Hampton<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a> Normal and Agricultural Institute, Williams College can
hardly be said to have added any special distinction. The college
honors itself fully as much as it does these, her honored sons,
in thus receiving them within the circle of those marked by an
expression of her distinctive regard. Both of them years before had
justly won their spurs. The Christian public, a circle wider than
any college, and not apt to be at fault in its judgment, either,
has for years honored these men because of their works’ sake. We
are glad, however, that Williams College, their Alma Mater, has
been first to voice this wider public sentiment. The American
Missionary Association congratulates the college in what it has
done, because the one, Rev. Henry Hopkins, D.D., is an honored
Vice President of the Association, and the other, Gen. Sam’l C.
Armstrong, LL.D., is at the head of one of the schools founded and
fostered by the Association, and still gloried in as a monumental
evidence of the grand work in which it is engaged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We call the attention of our readers to Rev. Mr. Pond’s article,
“Imperium in Imperio.” It is certainly a pathetic appeal to the
Christian women of America from the heathenism that has come to us
from China. It gives a new glimpse into our Chinese mission work,
and emphasizes its importance. We venture the suggestion that this
article would furnish interesting reading at ladies’ missionary
meetings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Grady’s famous speech before the New England Society, if things
keep going on at the South as they have been, is likely to become
infamous. He asserted for substance that the South had come to
recognize the fact that in the war the North was right, the South
wrong, that the Negro has the fullest protection of our laws and
the friendship of our people.</p>

<p>Recently, Rev. Leonard W. Bacon, who, strange to say, has been
for some time pastor of the Independent Presbyterian Church of
Savannah, Ga., preached to his people a patriotic sermon. He
emphasized the importance of national patriotism. He eulogized
Washington, Lincoln and Grant. He intimated that in the late
unpleasantness the South was wrong. The result of all this was an
excited congregation, an excited community, and the development of
such hostility that Mr. Bacon will probably be forced to resign.</p>

<p>Just a little while before the above incident, a colored
gentleman by the name of Council was refused permission to
ride in a first-class car, though he had paid for and held a
first-class ticket on the Georgia Central Railroad. Mr. Council
laid his grievance before the Interstate Commerce Commissioners.
Commissioner Bragg, of Alabama, happens to know the complainant,
and this is the way he testified concerning him: “I know Council
well. He is one of the brightest and best of our colored citizens.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a>
He is a stanch Democrat, and canvasses the State at every election
for the Democratic ticket. He is not a man who desires to push
himself forward because of any ambition to obtain social equality.
He is modest and unassuming. He is a gentleman.” On another page,
Field-Superintendent Ryder tells us of treatment received on a
Georgia railroad by Rev. Wm. Sinclair, one of our missionaries.
It is rather singular that these incidents happened in Georgia.
Mr. Grady is the editor of the leading newspaper of that State.
He ought to be able to testify as to its thought and feeling upon
the great questions that grew out of the war. It seems to us that
by this time he must begin to feel that his speech before the New
England Society in New York was a most unfortunate affair. We
shall be glad to find out what the New South is, but we shall not
be willing to take Mr. Grady as an instructor. The question still
remains: <em>Is</em> there a New South?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Fifth Annual Convention of the Colored Teachers’ Association
of Georgia was recently held in the House of Representatives Hall
at Atlanta. Upwards of one hundred colored teachers formed what
the local press called an “intelligent and decorous body.” The
sessions continued for three days. The papers gave full reports of
the proceedings. Much popular interest was taken. Many white people
attended. The range of the discussions was wide. The science of
teaching in all of its departments was introduced by papers and
addresses, and evoked very general discussion. It was a convention
of both interest and power. It was a demonstration, beyond all
doubt, of the Negro’s intellectual capacity and of his willingness
to use and improve it. One of our Atlanta teachers writing us about
this convention says: “I wish our Northern friends could have
attended it. I am sure, if they could have done so, those who are
helping would want to help more, and those who never have helped
would be stirred up to lend a hand in raising up a people, so
many of whom have proven and are proving that they can be raised.
Certainly those of us here on the field can but feel encouraged and
strengthened to go on.”</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>A GRADUATE AND A PORTER.</h3>

<p>There appeared in an Atlanta paper a few days ago, a paragraph
stating that a young Negro man of Atlanta, who had the best
university education, was acting as a porter in a cotton room, and
that all but two of his class, perhaps thirty, had dropped back
into just such work as he was doing, and saying that perhaps a good
deal of higher education was wasted.</p>

<p>This paragraph has been copied by a large number of papers and is
likely to injure the cause of education among the colored people,
and for this reason it seems necessary to call attention to the
errors it contains.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></p>

<p>The young man referred to has not a university education, but left
school during his freshman year. He was not a member of a class of
about thirty, although sometimes when his class recited with one in
the normal department, the two combined probably reached about that
number.</p>

<p>While he was junior preparatory his class numbered ten, and when he
was college freshman, eleven. Of these eleven, three went through
the course and were graduated. Two of these are teaching, one in
Texas, and the other as principal of a school in Chattanooga. The
third graduate is employed by a wealthy resident of Atlanta, at
whose home he always has lived, as collector of rents, etc., and
may be said to be “in business.”</p>

<p>So, instead of the young man in question having a university
education, he did not finish his freshman year; instead of his
being a member of a class of thirty, his class numbered only
eleven; and instead of thirty falling from the sublime heights of
university graduates to the low estate of porters in cotton houses,
the three of that class who completed their college course are
occupying the important positions mentioned above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this instance of misrepresentation is not an isolated
case, but one of a thousand of similar character. The statement
that the graduates from colored colleges are all idle vagabonds,
has become too stale to produce an impression any longer when made
in the abstract.</p>

<p>Now what are the facts upon this point? Let the published list of
graduates from the Atlanta University, with their occupations,
answer.</p>

<p>This school has a classical course of study covering a period of
seven years, for pupils who have completed the common English
branches. From this have been graduated forty students in ten
classes averaging four to a class. This university has also a
normal course of four years, for admission to which the same is
required as for admission to the classical course. From this have
been graduated in thirteen classes one hundred pupils, averaging
about eight to a class.</p>

<p>Of the forty graduates from the classical course, five are
dead, eight are in the service of the U.S. Government, four are
pastors of churches, one is a lawyer, two are in the theological
seminary, one is engaged in business in Atlanta, and the remaining
nineteen are teaching. None are unemployed and all are engaged in
occupations in which considerable education is required, and a
thorough one is desirable. It ought to be added that two of these
graduates are professors in colleges, one is editing a respectable
weekly newspaper, besides teaching, and one of those in the service
of the Government has been promoted three times upon merit alone.</p>

<p>Of the one hundred graduates from the normal department, six have
died, seventeen are keeping house for their husbands, one is in a
medical school, one is pursuing a college course, one is a mail
carrier, one is still living at home, one is a hired housekeeper,
and the remaining seventy-two are teaching.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></p>

<p>With reference to putting an education to a practical use, how many
schools in the United States can show a better record?</p>

<p>It may be said that a thorough education is not required to fit a
person for a government position, such as clerks in departments,
postal route agents and letter-carriers. But if such an education
enables one who has it to get from sixty to one hundred and thirty
dollars a month instead of seventy-five cents a day in the city
whenever he can obtain a job, or ten dollars a month and “rashuns”
in the country, it becomes to him an eminently and interestingly
practical thing. Even in the case of this young Negro porter, the
gentleman under whom he works says he could hire some one else to
do the same work for half his wages, but he prefers his services at
the double cost. If three years of Latin and two and a third years
of Greek and the mathematics that go with them double the value of
the services of a colored youth, let us challenge studies that are
usually considered more practical to show a better record and be
careful how we speak sneeringly of higher education.</p>

<p>But are occupations for the fullest use of a higher education by
colored people limited? They certainly are. A white pastor may
minister to a colored church, a white teacher may instruct colored
children, a white physician may prescribe for a colored patient, a
white attorney may counsel for a colored client, a white mechanic
may employ colored laborers, a white merchant may serve colored
customers, but in none of these spheres does the rule work both
ways except in a few rare instances. So the services of educated
colored people in the professions and in business are confined
to their own race, and in that they are crowded by their white
competitors. Furthermore they are not welcomed to these higher
walks of life even among their own people by their neighbors of the
more powerful race; but the general and almost universal public
sentiment is in favor of keeping them down. More than this, many of
their own race prefer the services of white lawyers, physicians,
ministers, teachers, mechanics and merchants.</p>

<p>Under all these adverse circumstances and others that might be
named, it requires great courage and perseverance in a colored
youth to complete a full course of study.</p>

<p>But should they be encouraged or dissuaded?</p>

<p>If the philosophy of civilization teaches anything it teaches that
Nature intended that every man should make the most of himself, and
every race should attain the highest possible development; and if
Christianity teaches anything it teaches the same lesson. Unless
some one knows for certain that the Negro is the descendant of Ham,
and that the descendants of Ham have not yet served their time in
hewing wood and drawing water, why not test the virtue of this
rather queer theory by trying, on a small scale, the experiment
of giving Negroes the opportunity of acquiring all the education
their mental capacity is capable of receiving, and looking on<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a> to
see what they will do with it, and what effect it will have upon
the race, and not expect that every individual will be a success or
achieve high place among men?</p>

<p>As the masses become enlightened the demand for well educated men
and women must increase. The “cornfield preacher” who depends upon
the “Sperrit” will step down and out, and the seminary graduate,
with “Bible religion” will take his place. Thoroughly trained and
equipped colored lawyers and physicians will conquer the prejudice
that now exists among their own people against them, and will
conquer it the more easily if they are better prepared for work
than their white competitors. All this need not come about in one
generation. We can transmit the work, with our faith and our hopes,
as a legacy to our children.</p>

<p>But, however divergent the views of different people may be upon
these questions, there certainly is no immediate occasion for a
howl against the higher education of the Negro, for there is not
enough of it to feed the flames of a respectable controversy. Only
a fraction of the so-called universities south of Washington open
to colored students have a collegiate course of study, and the
entire number of graduates from such a course can be expressed by
two ciphers and a small significant figure. What are a hundred or
two of college graduates among six or seven millions of people? The
shades of Hahnemann himself might echo the question.</p>

<h3>THINGS TO BE REMEMBERED—NO 3.</h3>

<p><em>The Danger!</em> Whatever of sentiment or of poetry may have appealed
to the imagination in the work of foreign missions, has been pretty
much dispelled by contact with foreign races at our own doors. We
find that they are intensely human, and that the task of saving
them is intensely real. The enchantment which comes of distance is
simple commonplace and matter of fact when the object is near at
hand. Hence the danger, now to be apprehended, is that of disgust,
or of indifference. Indeed we are not sure that the feeling has not
taken on a stronger form, and might not now be called hatred, or
scorn. If it be not one of these, what name shall we give to the
feeling towards the Chinese on the Pacific; towards the Indian,
driven from his hunting grounds and chased to the death by our
soldiery; towards the Negro, whipped and shot by midnight raiders,
unprotected by the government he helped to save, and left in his
ignorance, his poverty and his animalism by God’s people, on whom
he is cast for enlightenment and elevation?</p>

<p>How shall we see the vastness and urgency of the work for these
races with such repugnances and disgusts meeting us on the very
threshold? Moral ideas are of slow growth, and churches and
communities turn to new objects of sympathy and labor reluctantly
and sluggishly. While we<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a> hesitate and wait, the probability is
that things will take shape and pass beyond our control; or, at
best, that we shall but <em>partially</em> secure results which are now
fully within our reach. At this moment the churches of America
hold the key to the conquest of this world for Jesus Christ! Will
they hold it a generation hence? Not unless they take advantage of
their position to win these races to God before they are absorbed
into the world, and are thus lost as a regenerating force with
which to elevate the unsaved millions of mankind. Suppose, in our
supineness, we see the Chinese driven back into heathenism; the
Indian turned over to the soldiery for extermination, or a deeper
barbarism; the Negro wrested from his rights, and unlifted from
his passions, weaknesses and enthralments of mental and spiritual
darkness: is there any reason to believe that the opportunity
will ever return when it will be possible for us so completely to
control, guide and mould them as we now can?</p>

<p>We are in jeopardy, therefore, of making the most fearful mistake
in Christian ethics and in Christian practice. If these races pass
from our hands uneducated and unsaved, the world will charge us
with the commission of a crime against humanity itself. Now we can
throw upon these fields, if we will, men enough to take possession
of them in the name of Christ. Now, we can raise up <em>out of these
races</em> the laborers to carry our learning, our art, our faith, to
all who speak the same tongue, and to all in whose veins bounds the
same blood. To this work Providence manifestly calls us—to do it
is to walk with God, we verily believe. But whether the churches
see it, or <em>wish</em> to see it; whether they are more ready to walk
in their <em>own</em> light than in the light which shines from heaven, I
cannot answer. I can only say the sun shines, and we have the eyes
to see. If we miss the Divine plan and method it will not be for
lack of light, but the mistake will be none the less sad, and the
misfortune to the world none the less direful, because the ages may
not undo it. From such a peril may the good Lord save his people,
and open their eyes that they may see!</p>

<h3 title="Death of Rev. Sidney II. Dale">OBITUARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sidney Hamilton Dale</span>, pastor at Florence, Ala., died
June 18th, and was buried at Talladega, June 25th.</p>

<p>Mr. Dale was graduated from the Theological Department of Talladega
College, June, 1886, and at Christmas was ordained at Florence, the
sermon being preached by Prof. G.&nbsp;W. Andrews, who also conducted
the funeral services at Talladega. Some seventeen years before,
Mr. Dale, then a little boy, was converted in a revival of very
remarkable reach and power, at Marion, under the pastorate of
Mr. Andrews, who was then beginning his many years of service
in Alabama. After some time at the Lincoln Normal Institute, in
Marion, he came to Talladega, where, in addition to normal and
college preparatory studies, he pursued theology<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a> under the same
friend who had led him to Christ. He was diligent, growingly
diligent; in his studies strong, active and persevering. He had
a voice of remarkable compass and power, and he composed both
the words and music of the Class Song sung at his graduation.
He was devoted to the ministry, for which he had made years of
laborious preparation, and which he had begun with large promise
of usefulness. His illness continued but a few days, and death
was not expected till the end had almost come. But his faith was
strong. With exultant prayer and triumph he crossed the stream
into the better land. But it seems as if the fields this side, so
large and needy, could ill spare such a young and vigorous reaper;
and a heavy sorrow falls upon the young wife and mother who mourns
an unmeasured loss, yet not without the hope and comfort which God
alone can give.</p>

<h2>THE SOUTH.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>NOTES IN THE SADDLE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY FIELD-SUPERINTENDENT C.&nbsp;J. RYDER.</p>

<p>“Men are four: He who knows not and knows not he knows not, he
is a fool; shun him. He who knows not and knows he knows not, he
is simple; teach him. He who knows and knows not he knows, he is
asleep; wake him. He who knows and knows he knows, he is wise;
follow him.” So runs an old Arabic proverb. A sermon delivered
by one of our A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. pastors, before a class just graduating
from one of our Southern institutions, proves that in educational
matters this pastor was of the fourth class according to the Arabic
classification. The text of the sermon was Philippians iii, 13-14,
and the preacher spoke as follows, according to report in one of
the local papers:</p>

<p>“There are important lessons in these words of the Apostle Paul for
you. In finishing the course here you have only made a beginning.
The real work and the prize are ahead. A foundation has been laid
on which you must build, patiently, carefully, wisely. Healthy
spiritual and intellectual life are characterized by progress. This
is the touchstone, like a shining light, shining more and more unto
the perfect day. Education is the full development of the man,
and we know that development is a gradual, almost imperceptible
process. It is the leading out of the powers and capabilities which
he may possess. You do not educate a man when you simply tell him
what he did not know, but you do educate him when you make this
knowledge imparted a part of himself, thus causing him to feel what
he ought to feel—conscious power and manhood. Education which does
not make a man more manly and independent, is a decided failure. It
means growth. It is a man’s duty to grow. Remember, then, that you
have not apprehended—for what you must apprehend or <a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a>lay hold on,
is Christian character and manhood in its highest sense.”</p>

<p>Such manly and discriminating counsel coming from a graduate to
other graduates of his own race, proves that it is safe to appeal
to the results in proof of the value of higher education among the
colored people of the South.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Most refreshing news comes to us from a far-off church in Texas.
“Last Sabbath,” writes the faithful pastor, “was a high day for the
church here. Thirteen united with us, and many others were greatly
revived. Meetings of intense interest are still being held, and
many are coming forward for prayers and consecrating themselves to
the Lord.” A revival in midsummer! What a surprising phenomenon in
religious work at the North, but not so surprising for the South,
for there most earnest Christian work is often done during the
heated days of summer. The pastor who reports this encouraging
work has charge of three churches, and travels every week some
fifty miles by wagon in order to fill his appointments. He regrets
his inability to visit all the stations in his field regularly at
present, on account of the great interest at this one point and the
imperative demands there are upon him for special services here. He
begs the prayers of his brethren to whom he writes, and may I not
ask, through these Notes, for the prayers of a much larger circle
than those reached by his letter?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These Notes seem to be a scrap-bag, or a sort of patch-work quilt,
made up of bits gathered from different letters. Let me add one
more as illustrating two things: first, the extreme self-denial of
many who are contributing to the work of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., and also as
illustrating the high appreciation of this self-sacrifice on the
part of those who are doing the work in the field. A teacher whose
economy in traveling expenses had been so marked as to call for
commendation, writes: “It seems to me that we are in honor bound
to be more prudent in the use of A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. money than in the use of
our own. Some of the money given for the work in the South comes
from very humble people. I have heard of a poor woman in ——, who
earned her living by washing and scrubbing, yet saved out of her
scanty earnings a half cent a day for the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. It would be a
shame to any one to spend such money carelessly.” There are noble
heroism and self-denial on both sides of the line which divides the
two classes of those engaged in the work of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. When the
new Acts of the Apostles is written, it will include in its records
not only the Pauls and Peters who have gone out into this great
Southern field, but also the Tabithas “who are full of good works
and alms-deeds which they do” in their own homes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Where is the New South?” I repeat the question asked by the
editor<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a> of this magazine last month. Report just reaches us that
Rev. W.&nbsp;A. Sinclair, while traveling with his bride, has been
violently and brutally put out of a first-class railway coach and
forced into a “smoker,” although he held a first-class ticket which
he bought of the regularly appointed agent of the road. I do not
know the circumstances connected with this new outrage, but I <em>do</em>
know Rev. Mr. Sinclair, and know him to be a quiet, unostentatious,
unobtrusive Christian gentleman. There could have been no excuse
for this outrage. The “New South,” evidently, is not on the railway
trains in Georgia.</p>

<h3>HOWARD UNIVERSITY THEOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.</h3>

<p>The Theological Department of Howard University, Washington,
D.C., held its anniversary exercises on May 27th in the First
Congregational Church, in which was assembled a large audience of
colored and white people. Ten young men were graduated, four of
whom made interesting addresses. One of these was a Bulgarian,
who has also taken the medical course in the University, and will
return to his country as a missionary. Each graduate received a
Bible and a copy of Finney’s Autobiography. There were thirty-eight
theological students this year, and these included yet another
Bulgarian, who was converted under the missionaries of the American
Board, and was driven from his country by persecution, but who
hopes eventually to return thither.</p>

<p>Most encouraging reports were received during the year from former
graduates, who are hard at work in their respective fields, and
who to preaching add Sunday-school instruction, teaching in
day schools, temperance lecturing, and often housebuilding. No
department of our University yields richer fruit than does this.</p>

<h3>COMMENCEMENT AT FISK UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. A.&nbsp;P. MILLER, AN ALUMNUS.</p>

<p>Being absent on Thursday and Friday, I did not take in the
exercises of the Senior Preparatory Class and the literary
societies of the University, but learned that the young men and
women did themselves and their Alma Mater much credit in their
addresses and essays.</p>

<p>The missionary sermon was preached on Sunday morning by Rev. David
M. Harris, D.D., editor of a Presbyterian organ in Nashville. Dr.
Harris, who is a Southern gentleman, with much feeling referred to
the wrongs endured by the colored people in this country, saying
that he was heartily ashamed of their treatment in the past, but
that he had rather be the wronged than the perpetrators of the
wrong. The Doctor was much pleased with what had been accomplished
by Fisk University during<a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a> the trying years of her eventful history
for the elevation of the African race in this country, and, through
them, on the African continent.</p>

<p>The baccalaureate sermon in the afternoon, by Pres. E.&nbsp;M. Cravath,
D.D., commanded the closest attention; and at the close, the
President’s very feeling address to the graduates, four young men
and two young women, was very impressive. The music provided for
the services during the day by Prof. Spence and the Mozart Society
was of the highest order.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. F.&nbsp;A. Noble, of Chicago, arrived on Saturday, and
seemed to have taken in all round about him during his stay,
visiting classes in all departments under examination. The
exercises of the Normal Department of the University were richly
enjoyed, degrees being conferred on six young men and two young
women. The addresses and essays were thoughtfully conceived,
timely, and well delivered; and to one who, nine years ago, was
graduated from the University, showed marked evidence of advance.
While one member was delivering his address, his fellow-townsmen
were electing him to a position in their school on a salary of $75
per month.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Alumni associations of the University held their
anniversaries, addresses being delivered by Mrs. Ava Brown
Dismukes, class of ’77, Normal, and the Rev. Albert P. Miller, of
New Haven, Conn., class of 78, College. Mrs. Dismukes’ subject was
“Local Missions.” She vigorously enforced the duty of graduates,
wherever they may be, to make of themselves missionaries for the
upbuilding of the race. The Rev. A.&nbsp;P. Miller spoke on “The duty of
the hour,” and his address was listened to attentively throughout.
Dr. Noble emphasized Mr. Miller’s remarks as to the Negro’s lack
of sufficient moral courage to know and assert his rights. At the
close of the Alumni meetings, Gen. Clinton B. Fisk and wife put
in their appearance and were heartily applauded, and of course a
speech was called for and received with wonted enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Wednesday, beautiful and clear, came, bringing Commencement Day.
Teachers, students, friends and old graduates marched in procession
from Jubilee to Livingstone Hall. The exercises began at 10 <small>A.&nbsp;M.</small>
Music was grand. Addresses and essays gave evidence of
deep thought and careful preparation. Dr. Noble, in his afternoon
speech, said he never heard them excelled in any college, not even
in dear old Yale. Six received the degree of B.A.; some of them
having been in the institution fifteen years, and among those who
had been longest connected with the University was Miss Mary E.
Spence, only daughter of Prof. A.&nbsp;K. Spence, whom I found at Fisk
on entering, seventeen years ago.</p>

<p>Dr. Noble’s address, “Christian Socialism,” was timely, and had a
ring in it that thrilled the hearts of all who heard it. We who
were privileged to meet and hear this noble man and minister of
Christ cannot and will not soon forget him and his visit to Fisk.</p>

<p>After degrees had been conferred, Gen. Fisk delivered one of his
characteristic<a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a> speeches, thanking and blessing God for Fisk
University, with whose life he had been associated for more than
twenty years. He was proud of its history and of the work done by
its band of noble men and women and students, and urged graduates
to be something. Master’s degrees were conferred on W.&nbsp;R. Morris,
now teacher in Fisk; G.&nbsp;K. McIlvaine, of St. Louis, Mo., and Dr. A.
A. Wesley, recently graduated from medical school at Chicago.</p>

<p>What impressed me most was the desire expressed by the alumni of
Fisk to see their Alma Mater permanently endowed, and an intention
to work in the future among themselves and former students to this
end. The alumni have already pledged one per cent. of their annual
income toward an endowment fund, and as a result several hundred
dollars have been realized, and are now invested in a Nashville
bank. The ball was again started a-rolling at Commencement dinner,
Dr. Noble leading off, followed by Prof. Spence, with $10 each for
the class of ’87, and the amount ran up, swollen by contributions
of students, to about $150, and Gen. Fisk said he knew a gentleman
in New York who would double the sum subscribed on that occasion.
[This gentleman is doubtless Gen. F.] Rev. A.&nbsp;P. Miller was
appointed by the college alumni as corresponding secretary to work
up the endowment fund among the alumni and former students, and it
is to be hoped that friends of Negro education whom God has blessed
with means will turn their attention toward this University, whose
teachers and students have done so much for the mental and moral
regeneration of the South and the Negro race.</p>

<p>Fisk University must be endowed, and we her sons and daughters, who
intend doing what we can in this direction, most sincerely trust
that friends of years gone by will not forget, in the distribution
of what God hath given them, this institution, which has all these
years depended solely on God and a charitable public for its
existence and a continuance of its blessed work. May the richest
blessings of heaven come down on every one, whatever his or her
creed, white or black, who will help to permanently endow Fisk
University.</p>

<h3>COMMENCEMENT AT TALLADEGA COLLEGE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PRESIDENT H.&nbsp;S. DE FOREST, D.D.</p>

<p>Talladega’s seventeenth Commencement began Friday, June 10th, with
exercises of the lower grades from the Cassedy school, and ended
with the oration, essay, and a wedding at the Alumni meeting the
Thursday evening following. Between these dates were the sermon
before the graduates; a missionary sermon by Secretary Powell,
of New York; public examination of students in all grades, from
secondary studies up to theology, including classes taught in
Practice School by Normal Students; exercises of the three literary
societies; an address by Dr. Powell on<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a> “Over the sea”; one by
Dr. W.&nbsp;H. Ward on “The testimony of ancient monuments to God’s
Word”; exhibition of industrial work, with orations and essays
by graduates from the Normal and Theological departments. It was
a large bill of fare, we thought well served, and many were at
the table. The attendance all through was excellent, the house
being usually crowded, and often the overflow was very great. The
different examinations, it was conceded by all, gave evidence of
thorough study and solid attainments. Certainly thoroughness is
constantly sought, and those who visit the college bear witness to
good success in securing it. Two, new this year, graduated from
the Theological and thirteen from the Normal department. All are
professed Christians, are exemplary in life, and go to their work
with excellent preparation.</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon was given to inspection of the industrial
training. A display was made of the girls’ work in cutting, sewing
and repairing; of what the young men had done in blacksmithing,
carpentry and cabinet-making; while samples of cobbling were
walking all around. Students were seen painting, wood-working,
draughting; some were type-setting, form-making, and at press-work.
The garden, farm, wood-saw and feed-mill, stock and barns were
examined. All our visitors are impressed with the results already
secured in industrial training, and some are relieved who feared
that the brain, if it gets much of a start, will paralyze the hand,
forgetting that the hand must be inapt till there is a trained head
to give it cunning.</p>

<p>The mid-winter series of meetings, both at the college and the two
mission chapels, were blessed to several conversions. Young people
have been schooled in a vigorous Society of Christian Endeavor.
Mission Sunday-schools and neighborhood prayer-meetings have
been carried on with growing interest. The different benevolent
societies have had their claims presented in turn; something has
been given to all; and if the offerings have been small, they have,
it is believed, been weighted with prayer.</p>

<p>Important repairs, so far as means are afforded, are to be made by
industrial students. Board is now to be made cheaper, and, with,
no less attention to fundamental branches, more is to be done in
developing college studies; and theological training, a strong
point from the beginning, is still to be kept in the foreground. At
the close of another good year, the college looks hopefully towards
the future.</p>

<h3>COMMENCEMENT AT TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p>Whatever else we may have or fail to have at our annual
Commencement time, we always <em>expect</em> rain, and we are rarely
disappointed in this particular. This year rain was so greatly
needed, and had been so long devoutly wished for, that it was one
of our causes of rejoicing. However, the showery character of
the weather prevented our having the usual full<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a> attendance on
Commencement Sabbath; but by Commencement day we had many visitors
from a distance, who, with our school family and people from our
own vicinity, filled all the space of our new chapel—not quite so
closely as it might have been packed, but comfortably full; the
largest attendance being had at the concert, Wednesday evening,
June 1. These concerts grow in excellence and in favor from year to
year, and our choir has, besides, won some modest laurels, singing
outside the University, which it has worn as modestly.</p>

<p>Our Sunday-school is always delightful, and nothing else is ever
permitted to take its place. At the close of this year we had the
pleasure of disposing of seventy dollars of Sunday-school money.
Forty dollars were voted to missionary work in Africa, twenty-five
to library books, and five to the State temperance lecturer of
Mississippi. A larger average attendance than ever before was
reported.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon a Home Mission Institute was held. A list of
topics was presented two weeks beforehand, but no set speeches or
prepared papers were given. The young people, led by President
Pope, did nearly all the talking, and it was good to hear the
earnest and practical way in which they discussed such topics as
these:</p>

<p>“What can we do—</p>

<p>“To secure the better observance of the Sabbath?”</p>

<p>“To introduce good reading matter into the homes of the people?”</p>

<p>“To make our industrial training do home missionary work?”</p>

<p>“By what means can we best promote the interest of the people in
schools, Sunday-schools, missions, temperance, personal and social
purity?”</p>

<p>“What societies shall we seek to organize, or shall we combine all
these aims in Societies of Christian Endeavor?”</p>

<p>In the evening President Pope delivered the sermon to the
graduates, speaking with even more than his wonted force and fervor
in view of his farewell to this field and the transfer of his labor
to the mountain work in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Besides the oral examinations of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,
there were black-board drawings and displays of written work in
each room, so that those who passed through might see something of
the work of each grade. There were also industrial exhibits of the
young ladies’ work, and work from the shops. Col. Power, of the
State Board of Visitors, spoke of our new school-house and shops
themselves as being a most gratifying industrial exhibit, having
been so largely the work of our apprentices.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon the black-boards in one of the large
school-rooms were seen to bear these scrolls, in dashing capitals:
“Welcome, Alumni!” and “There’s no place like Home.” And presently
about a score of Tougaloo graduates, with teachers and friends,
were gathered to listen to an address by Mr. J.&nbsp;N. Granberry, one
of the very first class graduated<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a> here. He said, in beginning,
that he had decided to take for his theme “That which most men try
to shirk, namely: ‘Duty.’” He then spoke of the duty of the sons
and daughters of this institution to themselves, to their school,
to their people, to their country, to the world at large, basing
all upon the thought of duty to God.</p>

<p>At a business meeting, next morning, of the Society of the Alumni,
President Pope pledged funds with which to erect, within two years,
an Industrial Cottage for Girls, and the Alumni pledged funds
for the furnishing. This is with a view to placing our girls’
industries more nearly on an equal footing with those for young
men. In the meantime our good friend, Mr. Ballard, of New York, has
again come to our rescue and made it possible to set the enterprise
of girls’ housekeeping on foot at once—that is, next year—in a
small way, as we can with our present accommodations.</p>

<p>An unusual number of graduates were present at Commencement, and
enjoyed their own separate dinner and “the olive branches” about
the table. There were never so many babies at Tougaloo before, and
a well-behaved and promising little company we thought them, upon
the whole. May God bless the little ones and make them every one
burning and shining lights in His kingdom! Our graduating class was
small this year—two young ladies from the Elementary, and a young
man from the Higher Normal. The exercises were good.</p>

<p>We have always listened with pleasure and profit, each recurring
year, to our annual address, by whomsoever delivered, and faithful
and eminent men have thus favored us; but never have we experienced
greater delight in this part of our service than this year while
being addressed by that grand, large-hearted, eloquent divine and
stanch friend of the colored people from <em>ante-bellum</em> days, the
Rev. Dr. C.&nbsp;K. Marshall, of Vicksburg. He seemed not at all to
address himself to colored people as such, but from a glowing heart
to pour forth universal truth for universal humanity, in the most
genial spirit, counseling our young people as young people anywhere
might rejoice to be counseled on the threshold of active life.</p>

<p>After so prolonged a “feast of reason,” the mortal bodies demanded
refreshment, and the afternoon was far spent when all had been
served. Then good-byes were spoken, students and visitors departed,
and a sort of lonesome quiet settled over Tougaloo; but the chosen
motto of our graduating class looks down in letters of unfading
green from over the rostrum, “Life is earnest,” and carries our
prayerful thoughts out to the army of young workers who, in their
several homes, schools and places of labor, we trust are earnestly
endeavoring to walk in the footsteps of our blessed Master and
“overcome evil with good.”</p>

<h3>GREGORY INSTITUTE, WILMINGTON, N.C.</h3>

<p>Our closing exercises this year partook more of the nature of a
Commencement than heretofore. This is the second year only that our
school has turned out graduates from any of the higher courses.
From the class of ten comprising the elementary normal class,
seven—five young men and two young women—were graduated. One
other young man, who failed to pass on account of being absent
teaching during a part of the year, and who is working hard,
determined to make up the lost studies before leaving the city,
will probably succeed and be granted his certificate during the
summer.</p>

<p>The exercises were held on Thursday evening, May 27th, in the
church instead of in the hall, in order to get a larger room.
It was needed, the largest number being present that were ever
assembled within the walls of this beautiful building.</p>

<p>The exercises consisted principally of orations and essays by
the members of the graduating class, interspersed with singing,
all of which were rendered in a highly creditable manner. In
addition to these were recitations by the school of the 23d Psalm,
a Scripture catechism learned during the year, and a missionary
colloquy beautifully rendered by girls from the different classes,
representing, by their dress, many of the heathen nations.</p>

<p>Another and a very interesting feature of the evening’s
entertainment, was a half-hour address by Rev. Geo. S. Smith,
pastor of the Congregational Church, Raleigh, N.C. He was
introduced to the audience as a colored man who had been trained in
the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. schools, and a noble specimen he is, as an orator, as
a scholar, and as a man. He chose for his subject, “Encouragement,”
from which he delivered an address replete with sound practical
thoughts and advice.</p>

<p>A better behaved, more attentive audience scarcely ever gathered
than that at our Commencement. We feared that they might not like
these exercises as well as those of the usual exhibition order,
but many said this was the best exhibition we ever had. Everything
passed off nicely, with nothing to mar the enjoyment of the evening.</p>

<p>As we looked at the people before us, we thought: “How could any
one in this Christian land have ever said, ‘These niggers have
no souls’; or, ‘You can’t educate a nigger to make anything of
him’?” Even at this late day we hear these or kindred expressions.
I tell you, friends, if you were thrown with this people as we
teachers are, you would soon almost forget that they are colored.
Please don’t forget that they are here to stay, 7,000,000 of them,
and they need your help to rise from their despised, neglected
condition. They are surely marching onward, but much, <em>very</em> much,
yet remains for the Christians of our land to do.</p>

<p>Our enrollment for the past year has been 285, but the average
attendance has not been quite up to the usual mark, owing to
sickness, “hard <a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a>times,” etc. Death has entered the school, taking
away two of the number, both youths of special promise.</p>

<p>Our workers have never been more untiring in their efforts to
advance the cause of temperance and morality. A flourishing Band of
Hope, taking in nearly every pupil in the three lower departments,
has been doing its good work throughout the year. The society for
the older ones, not strictly confined to the school, has also been
doing its work. White Cross societies have been formed, and without
doubt will prove of great help to their members. The Band of Mercy
belonging to the First Primary Division should not be forgotten.
The school prayer-meeting has been encouraging, and considerable
time has been taken up in the study of the Scriptures.</p>

<h2>THE INDIANS.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<h3>CLOSING EXERCISES AT SANTEE NORMAL TRAINING SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>A beautiful feature of the Commencement season here at Santee was
the communion service of last Sunday, at which time six young
Indian men came forward from among their companions and publicly
united themselves to God’s people! We call them boys, but they are
not boys; they are old enough to realize the position they now
occupy, and it has come to them only after the long, hard struggle
which seems always to insure earnest lives for the future. Most
beautiful of all was the baptism! Tears rolled down their cheeks as
they bent for a blessing from the white man’s God and their God.</p>

<p>The eyes of the teachers, who had prayed and labored so earnestly
for this very occasion, were filled to overflowing. Five different
tribes were represented by these boys: Mandan, Ree, Assinaboine,
Yanktonais and Titon. Two of the young men are the sons of chiefs
still in their blankets, who, recognizing the great needs of their
people, are urging their sons on to more earnest study, so that
they may come back as missionaries to those who wait for them as
for deliverers.</p>

<p>It would seem enough of an achievement that these scores of Indian
boys and girls have been brought out of the superstition, the
unbelief, the savagery of their tribes, into the customs, manners
and religion of civilization, even if the work stopped there; but
the three days following the communion Sabbath have shown such
results in regard to a growth as well as change of mind, that to
one seeing the work for the first time it is simply marvelous.</p>

<p>It is one thing to sit in an Eastern audience and listen to
the most earnest recital of the needs of, and work among, the
Indians, and to say, “O, yes, the needs are very great; the work
is glorious; we fully understand <a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a>your solution of the ‘Indian
problem’; we agree with you and aid you!” (while in a day the needs
are forgotten, and the work is overlooked). It is another thing to
stand here on the ground and listen to the silent appeals of these
hundreds of thirsty human souls—appeals that are all the stronger
because of their utter helplessness. Another thing is it to stand
and <em>behold</em> the work already done, and the change already made! To
see with our own eyes is to wonder and believe, in such a way that
we can never forget. Would that all men might not only hear, but
see!</p>

<p>On Friday, the 24th, began the yearly examinations of the Santee
Normal Training School. Teachers and scholars were alive to the
duties placed upon them, and the end of the seventeenth year
found all active as ever. The recitations extended throughout
Friday, Monday and Tuesday, and visitors from the Agency and
surrounding towns were made welcome. The school-rooms, thrown open
together, were well filled during most of the sessions. Especially
interesting was the map-drawing and accompanying recitation by the
older geography students. The recitation showed that an Indian may
have as clear and correct an idea of the formation of this earth
and its divisions into hemispheres, countries, etc., as any white
boy. The maps were accurately and admirably drawn. The language
lessons were novel, and showed good work on the part of the
teachers. Stories were read to the students which they were asked
to re-write in as good English as possible. The following from a
boy brought into the school last fall, is a good illustration of
the way in which they think and speak in English: “We get all our
silk from a little creature called worm. The little creature is
green color. She lay number of eggs and then died, and they have
never seen their children and father.”</p>

<p>Music is by no means drudgery to the Indians. Passionately fond of
it, they practice with patience, and the results have been more
than satisfactory. Considering the lack of all discipline in their
natures, the examinations this year, both in vocal and instrumental
music, have been remarkable. Those thousands in the East who heard,
last winter, the singing of the Santee quintette, can easily
believe that this is true.</p>

<p>Gymnastics have been practiced as a means of teaching accuracy and
quickness of thought. The precision acquired by the students shows
that it has been a good discipline, and would do credit to any
school.</p>

<p>The recitations in mathematics were good. The work in algebra
deserves special mention. One thing is very evident in studying
the school work here; that is, that while in everything requiring
simple memory the Indian is fully equal to the white boy, perhaps
more than equal, his reasoning faculties are much behind, on
account of the lack of such faculties in the generations of his
ancestors; so mathematical work requires patient plodding, month
after month, for each step gained. There is very great need of such
discipline among this people, and it is one of the most difficult
things in this work of education and Christianization.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></p>

<p>Twenty minutes were given on Monday to the workings of a model
normal class in botany. It was most unique, carried on wholly by
the advanced students. They showed clearly the most approved manner
and methods not only of teaching, but also of learning. The whole
was skillfully and understandingly done.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening was devoted to a literary entertainment. Space
allows only of a word or two in regard to it. A former graduate
of Santee, who is now one of its teachers, read an essay on
“Civilization” well worth repeating. He began with the earliest
known civilization before Christ; came down through the centuries
with examples proving Christianity to be the mainspring of modern
civilization, ending with a touching picture of the angels of God
looking down upon this, the greatest nation of the world, and
watching anxiously to see it turn a listening ear to the plea of
the poor Indian for this very knowledge of God, which he realizes
is his only salvation, his only path to the civilization for which
he longs. Beautifully pathetic were the words in which he spoke of
our common brotherhood and of the longing of his people for better
things.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning the exercises opened with a battalion drill,
and later, time was given to an exhibition of the industrial
work of the students. The blacksmith, carpenter and shoe shops
held proof of good solid work on the part of the boys; while the
needle-work of the girls and small boys was exceptional. The talent
for free-hand drawing is very general among the Indians, and the
collection of specimens was good.</p>

<p>The exercises closed on Wednesday evening with a social gathering
in the large dining hall. There were present all the boys and
girls of the school, the teachers, employees, and many visitors.
Blanketed Indians mingled with the rest, and many nationalities
were represented. It was a novel company, but all were happy and
glad. With the close of the evening, Santee finished a successful
year. Very early on Thursday morning nearly a score of the students
were busy with preparations for departure. In the quiet of the dawn
some of us heard the sound of music, most unusual at this hour; and
one of the teachers venturing to the chapel, found the young men
holding a meeting for prayer. It was their own idea; they had waked
one another quietly for it. It was the surest safeguard against
the temptations they were going out to meet. This single incident
shows better than words the missionary spirit pervading the whole
school. And so, to-day, with the departure of the students, goes
out the gospel influence of Santee—far North into Canada, East
into Minnesota, and West into Montana, never to diminish, but to
grow and spread until the white man’s God shall be indeed the God
of all the Indians.</p>

<p>What is true of the advance of the pupils of Santee is indicative
of the advance of the whole people. There is surely a bright day
coming for the Indian.</p>

<h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>IMPERIUM IN IMPERIO.</h3>

<p>The story which I have to tell this month may startle our readers
east of the Rockies, though the hard fact underlying it has long
been known to us on this Pacific slope, and especially in San
Francisco.</p>

<p>On Sunday, June 5th, among seven Chinese who were baptised and
received to Bethany church, was one young woman about fifteen
years of age. She was the second female Chinese received to our
fellowship, for out of more than 120 of that nation whom I have
baptised, all but two have been males.</p>

<p>This young woman is remarkably beautiful in person, pleasing in
her ways, and interesting in character. Her father is in China.
Her mother, quite in accordance, perhaps, with the moralities of
Chinese heathenism, had taken to herself another husband for the
time being, and had gone to Arizona to ply her trade, the nature of
which I do not <em>certainly</em> know, and therefore will not suggest. To
raise funds she had <em>pawned</em> this girl for $250, but had paid $100
on her debt. A very estimable Chinaman, not a professed Christian,
but one of whom we have hoped much, knowing the parties and hearing
that little Ah Yung was being harshly treated, advanced the balance
of the debt and took possession of the child. He placed her in the
family of our helper, Jee Gam. Thus she became known to the lady
teachers in our Central Mission, one of whom went up-stairs each
evening to the apartments occupied by Jee Gam’s family, to give her
a lesson, and also (as always) to speak to her of Christ.</p>

<p>At first indifferent and even hostile, she softened at length,
and began to wish that she might become a Christian. With this
softening of the heart towards Christ, there rose, of course, an
abhorrence and dread of the destiny which, according to heathen
customs, awaited her. She did not, however, at first open her heart
fully to her teacher, but said that she would like to earn some
money, and to work for wages in some American family. A place was
found for her which, as being a little remote from the city, was
likely to be a safe refuge. But when the time for her removal came,
unexpected obstacles were interposed. Jee Gam, while quite willing
to have her go, felt that it would be neither honorable nor safe
for him to deliver her to any one except the man who entrusted her
to him; and this one shrunk from the responsibility of letting her
go where it might be difficult for her mother to resume possession
of her. Meanwhile the case became more urgent because of a report
that her mother would soon be in San Francisco, for, with her
arrival, all possibility of legal protection for the child would be
gone. Miss Jessie S. Worley, the principal of our Central School,
suddenly cut the knot by causing herself, with no<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a> one’s consent
except that of the child, to be appointed her legal guardian, and
she holds her under such protection now.</p>

<p>The day after Ah Yung’s baptism, I think it was, the mother
appeared. Entreaties proving vain, she sought by other methods
to bring her daughter under her own control, or else to get from
some one the coin she was supposed to be worth; for such a girl,
just budding into womanhood, in our Chinese matrimonial market, is
said to be worth from $500 to $1,500. Last Saturday the Chinaman
who had befriended Ah Yung appeared at my study. It was with great
difficulty that he could maintain his self-control, though he is a
man of strong and steady nerves. His lips quivered as he talked,
and his athletic frame often trembled. The mother had appealed to
the Six Companies, and his life was at stake. Since then, as I
have been informed, a meeting of the representatives of the Six
Companies has been held, and our friend was summoned to appear
before them. He was given till to-day (June 17th) to restore the
girl to her mother—an act entirely beyond his power. Meanwhile,
the High-Binders were already on his track, and he scarcely feels
safe even in Oakland and in his own employer’s house. He will
probably be obliged to flee, perhaps to some point far East, for he
will not be able, even if disposed, to surrender the dear child to
the fate to which, in her mother’s hands, she would be doomed.</p>

<p>This has brought closer home to me than ever before the fact of an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</i> in our Chinese communities. It stirs one’s
blood to think that this young man can make no effective appeal to
our Government against this secret tyranny. It may very likely be
that if he should be murdered, his murderer, if convicted, would be
hung; but this is at best a cold and shadowy comfort in the present
emergency.</p>

<p>“A good argument, this,” some one avers, “for hustling the whole
brood out of the land!” But in so doing we should not help
ourselves at all, and we should hustle them back into deeper
darkness and severer cruelty. A good argument, rather, as it
seems to me, for pouring in with intenser zeal and more practical
endeavor, the life-giving, freedom-giving light of Christ.</p>

<h2>BUREAU OF WOMAN’S WORK.</h2>

<p class="secauth">MISS D.&nbsp;E. EMERSON, SECRETARY.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Our matrons and teachers find much to interest them in studying the
characteristics of the students as exhibited in their school life,
and especially are they interested in following the students during
vacations to their homes and among the people on the plantations.
Witness the following extracts from the correspondence of one of
our matrons:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></p>

<p>I think you would be more surprised and delighted to make a tour
of our Boys’ Hall, as I did one evening a few weeks before school
closed, than to go through the Ladies’ Hall, because you might
not expect so much of the young men. I must say, the absolute
cleanliness, order and quiet that reigned as I went around in the
time of evening study, was more than I expected.</p>

<p>Nearly every room had its pictures, every one its little case
for books, some a window full of plants, and all the ordinary
conveniences spick and span, with the beds beautifully made up.
Some rooms, especially those of the apprentices, were full of
ingenious little contrivances which they have made themselves,
and so, of course, take double pleasure in. Their matron kept a
diligent eye for something to criticise, and, sure enough, some
of their books were wrong end up, and she asked the boys if they
expected people to stand on their heads to read the titles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The comfort, convenience and neatness of our plain little rooms,
where the girls, and equally the boys, are required to have “a
place for everything, and everything in its place,” form by painful
contrast one of the special trials of our young people when they go
out to cabin life in their teaching and other vacation work.</p>

<p>After they have learned to love the new way, it is very hard for
them to have no room to themselves, no facilities for bathing, and
small chance to display the good taste they have learned to use in
the arrangement and care of their personal belongings.</p>

<p>One of our older girls, who keeps a gem of a room here, felicitates
herself on having a room to herself where she boards, even though
tucked up and the walls full of other people’s clothes, a saddle,
and sundries.</p>

<p>Another of our girls passing through her first experience of “going
out,” wrote a wofully homesick letter, saying there was no place to
hang up or lay down anything where she was staying; that her trunk
had to go under her bed, and after she had made her morning toilet
she couldn’t even find room to put down her comb and brush, but had
to haul out her trunk and put them back into it. We expect to hear
a more cheerful song after her school fills up and she becomes busy
and interested, for she is really a very energetic girl, practical
and positive. We have written advising her to get her brother, who
is skillful with tools and teaches near enough to visit her on
Saturdays, to put up some shelves and other conveniences in her
school-room, to make that as homelike as possible, have her sewing
there, and gather her girls in to learn to sew, crochet, etc., if
practicable.</p>

<p>[This brother is one of our Biblical class, and already beginning
to preach. He had a tramp of a hundred miles or so after school
closed, looking for work for himself and others, back from the
railway in the more inaccessible regions, where the schools are not
snapped up so quickly. In<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a> writing of his search, he said: “I have
had what some would call a hard time, but I have enjoyed it, and I
<em>know</em> that the Lord is with me.” Blessed assurance!]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the girls write, sooner or later, to their matron after going
home. Some of the letters are rather amusing.</p>

<p>One harum-scarum little miss, who made no end of care when here,
after being home a fortnight seems to have been visited with some
sense of her shortcomings, and wrote: “If I live I am coming back
in the fall, and try to be a better girl than I was before.”</p>

<p>She refers to the text of Scripture that had been given them all as
a watchword, and says she often thinks of it; then, as if to confer
a like benefit upon her kind friend, she opens her Bible at random
and copies: “And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes
and shave off all his hair and wash himself in water that he may be
clean.” After two or three more of similar tenor, she says: “Think
of these verses as long as you live, and also of me,” and ends all
by this new rendering of a familiar passage: “Be not overcome evil
with good, but overcome good with evil.” Encouraging, isn’t it?</p>

advance in the adaptation of special knowledge and general
literature to the intelligent comprehension of pupils of all
grades of attainment. While in no wise tending to do away with the

suggestive and valuable information and specific knowledge,

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
